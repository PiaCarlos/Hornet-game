# Toward a Tower Defense Game

## Overview
A  **Tower Defense game** implemented in **Java**, where bees defend their hive against advancing hornets.  
The project demonstrates **object-oriented design**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **custom data structures** to model game mechanics.

## Features
- Board system with `Tile` objects for food, hives, nests, and path connections.  
- Insects hierarchy: abstract `Insect`, `Hornet`, and specialized bees (`BusyBee`, `AngryBee`, `FireBee`).  
- Custom `SwarmOfHornets` data structure (queue-like).  
- Core mechanics: movement, combat, food collection, hive defense, fire damage.  

## Technologies
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Custom dynamic data structures
